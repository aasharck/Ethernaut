Reentrant attacks can be done by calling a function over and over again(generally a withdraw function), so that you can drain the funds.
To do that we just need to add an attack function which call the function from the contract over and over. But we can't do it manually - so we place it inside the receive function so that whenever we recevive some ether the function gets called again and we drain the contract.
